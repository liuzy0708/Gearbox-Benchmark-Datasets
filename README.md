# Multi-mode Fault Diagnosis Datasets of Gearbox Under Variable Working Conditions

## Overview
This repository contains vibration datasets in ".csv" format collected from a gearbox under variable working conditions. The data includes three-axis vibration acceleration signals from the motor drive end and the gearbox intermediate shaft, key phase signals (speed data) from the motor output shaft, and torque data from the gearbox input shaft. These datasets are valuable for research in vibration analysis, machine condition monitoring, and fault diagnosis in mechanical engineering applications.


## Data Description
- **Type**: Datasets in ".csv" format
- **Data Collection**: Two three-axis acceleration sensors were used to collect vibration acceleration signals, a photoelectric sensor for key phase signals (speed data), and a torque sensor for torque data.
